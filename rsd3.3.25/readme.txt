Right now I have a date check file that checks to see if the day is a weekend or weekday. Then I have a time function that checks to see if we are within trading hours. That information gets passed to a check file. That check file gets read from my main file. When the main file is run, it passes the current date into a log file. The main file also will check the log file to see if the current date is contained before it runs which will prevent the program from running more than once per day.
